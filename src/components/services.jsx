        <h2>My Coaching Sessions</h2>
        <p>I gear my consulting services towards businesses, organizations, and entities to help them develop in their respective industries. My consulting work centers around ecosystem consulting, creating cross capacities, and breaking down silos. When consulting, I focus on creating more human-centered products and services. Some of my past consulting projects have involved workforce development, economic development, and the future of work. I provide successful results because of the culmination of my skills and 13 years of consulting experience. </p>
